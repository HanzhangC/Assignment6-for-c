In this code, I worked on a C program that implements a simplified community detection algorithm for social networks. The program processes user profiles, calculates the strength of connections between users based on their friendships, and detects core users who have a high number of close friends. It also identifies unique hashtags used by each community, helping to analyze the interests of different user groups.
